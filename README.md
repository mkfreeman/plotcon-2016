# Plotcon-2016 slides

This code is used to build [Mike Freeman's](https://twitter.com/mf_viz) slides on _**Visualizing Concepts with D3.js**_ for [Plotcon 2016](https://plotcon.plot.ly/).

## Resources
Many open source projects were used to build these slides, including:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- Application state is managed with [React-Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
- Interactive visualizations built with [D3.js v4](https://d3js.org/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
